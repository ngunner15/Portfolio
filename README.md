# Portfolio Website

My website made to showcase my skills in Front-End Web Development. Used Webpack to bundle CSS and JavaScript files. Made use of Bootstrap to make the website responsive and mobile friendly. Also utilized couple of jQuery plugins to make animations and nice effects. Hosted on Netlify.

Main goal of this website was to learn each of the above features.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Implements webpack --config webpack.config.js

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in a development server port - 4000.

### `npm run build`

Builds dist folder for Netlify servers to host this website.
