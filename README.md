# Portfolio Website

My website made to showcase my skills in Front-End Web Development. Used Webpack to bundle CSS and JavaScript files. Made use of Bootstrap to make the website responsive and mobile friendly. Also utilized couple of jQuery plugins to make animations and nice effects. Hosted on Netlify.

Main goal of this website was to learn each of the above features.
